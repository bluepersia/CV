# CV

# Marco Enrique Zimmermann
I'm a developer, with a background in developing games but now focusing on web development.
Programming and playing guitar are my two greatest talents and I therefore also have experience as as a live-performing guitarist. 
I am self-taught.

I enjoy the challenge of coding and doing the best I can on whatever needs to be done.

I'm self-driven, hard working and friendly. 

NOTE: For the sake of demonstrating my affinity with IT, I will include my experience as a game programmer, starting at the age of 14.

## Experience (Programming in general):
### Mod creator (2006)
Around the age of 14 I started to delve into programming mods for games and little Flash apps. Some of the mods received praise as being 'the best mod for this game'. I believe this was because of a combination of personal curiosity and the motivation to find out how to build these mods. 

### Multiplayer Games (AS3, PHP, MySQL) (2009)
As I was studying in London at the age of 17, I started delving into programming MMO games on the side very intensely. This involved getting the Front end of the game (Flash) to use GET/POST requests with PHP in order to create, update, get or delete data in a MySQL database. I also coded the game mechanics and drew the art, which were for a complex RPG game. Friends showed these projects to their IT teacher at my old school, and the class was very impressed by the work I did.

### OneShark Indie games (2011)
Here began a serious sidejob as a game developer in a team of 3 people. I was the sole programmer. We began small, with games that had no backend. After only 2-3 releases I got us into creating MMO games, of which you can play some at https://www.kongregate.com/games/BluePersia/esgrima-2. These games became successful with over 600,000 gameplays. They involved Front-end and Back-end development with heavy CRUD work with a database.

### Unity (C#, PHP, MySQL) (2014)
We switched over to Unity and continued working on large MMO games. However, the changes in the game industry were not for me, and I eventually decided to pursue other interests.

### Some games I've coded that involved back-end:
#### Medieval Crusade 2 Online
#### Esgrima Online
#### Esgrima 2 

## Experience (Web development)
## Self-teaching and Courses (2019)
Seeking to get back into programming, I researched and learned about Web development and the languages relevant for it. Javascript is almost identical to AS3, so I started there.
